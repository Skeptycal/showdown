        Showdown is a simple Markdown previewer. It renders Markdown as HTML
        (using ldiscount) and loads it in a WebKitGTK view (using LGI).
        The interface is very minimal, since it's only intended purpose is to
        preview Markdown files from the command line as quickly as possible.
